# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dam Attack game is a Tetris-style puzzle game with a beaver theme that runs on Reddit's Devvit platform. The game currently has several critical issues affecting gameplay, user experience, and code maintainability. This spec addresses comprehensive improvements to create a polished, bug-free gaming experience.

3. WHEN UI elements are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing, alignment, and readability
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback
5. WHEN the game is played on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately while maintaining visual quality

### Requirement 5: Implement Proper Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain consistent state so that gameplay is predictable and reliable.

3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL reset all state to initial values
5. WHEN multiple game sessions occur THEN the system SHALL prevent state leakage between sessions

### Requirement 6: Optimize Performance and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code so that the game runs efficiently and can be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates without performance drops
2. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices and proper error handling
3. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL have proper null checks and type safety
4. WHEN memory is allocated THEN the system SHALL clean up resources appropriately to prevent leaks
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error messages

### Requirement 7: Improve Audio and Feedback Systems

**User Story:** As a player, I want audio feedback and sound effects so that the game feels more engaging and responsive.
