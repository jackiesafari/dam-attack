# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dam Attack game is a Tetris-style puzzle game with a beaver theme that runs on Reddit's Devvit platform. The game currently has several critical issues affecting gameplay, user experience, and code maintainability. This spec addresses comprehensive improvements to create a polished, bug-free gaming experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical UI Freezing and Stability Issues

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to remain responsive when I change between mobile, desktop, and fullscreen views so that I can play without the interface freezing.

4. WHEN resize events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce them properly to prevent layout thrashing
5. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance across all view modes

### Requirement 2: Fix Reddit Username Integration

**User Story:** As a Reddit user playing on Devvit, I want my Reddit username to be properly retrieved and displayed so that my scores are attributed to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads in Devvit THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve the current Reddit username
2. WHEN the username is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display it in the game interface
3. WHEN scores are saved THEN the system SHALL use the Reddit username instead of a generic placeholder
4. WHEN the Devvit API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to cached or default usernames
5. WHEN debugging username issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging about the retrieval process

### Requirement 3: Improve Mobile Touch Controls and Input Reliability

**User Story:** As a mobile player, I want responsive and reliable touch controls so that I can play the game effectively on my device without input lag or missed taps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap mobile control buttons THEN the system SHALL respond immediately with visual feedback
2. WHEN I perform touch gestures THEN the system SHALL register all inputs without missing taps
3. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback where supported
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain control responsiveness
5. WHEN multiple touches occur THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately without conflicts

### Requirement 4: Enhance Visual Design and User Interface

**User Story:** As a player, I want an attractive and consistent visual design so that the game feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display consistent theming across all screens
2. WHEN pieces are displayed THEN the system SHALL render them with clear, distinct colors and proper borders
3. WHEN UI elements are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing, alignment, and readability
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback
5. WHEN the game is played on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately while maintaining visual quality

### Requirement 5: Implement Proper Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain consistent state so that gameplay is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is paused or resumed THEN the system SHALL maintain all game state correctly
2. WHEN transitioning between scenes THEN the system SHALL preserve necessary data and clean up resources
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL reset all state to initial values
5. WHEN multiple game sessions occur THEN the system SHALL prevent state leakage between sessions

### Requirement 6: Optimize Performance and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code so that the game runs efficiently and can be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates without performance drops
2. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices and proper error handling
3. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL have proper null checks and type safety
4. WHEN memory is allocated THEN the system SHALL clean up resources appropriately to prevent leaks
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error messages

### Requirement 7: Improve Audio and Feedback Systems

**User Story:** As a player, I want audio feedback and sound effects so that the game feels more engaging and responsive.
