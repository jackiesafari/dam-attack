  - iPhone 12 (390x844) portrait and landscape  
  - Samsung Galaxy S21 (360x800) portrait and landscape
  - iPad Mini (768x1024) portrait and landscape
- Screen resize event handling
- Mobile vs desktop detection
- Portrait vs landscape orientation detection
- Appropriate control layout recommendations
- Consistent button spacing across screen sizes
- Game board visibility with controls

**Key Features Tested:**
- Layout calculations for 8 different screen configurations
- Responsive positioning of controls and game board
- Proper spacing and alignment maintenance
- Device type detection (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Orientation-aware layout adjustments

### 6. Enhanced Mobile Controls Integration ✅

**Verified:**
- All enhanced features work together seamlessly
- Performance maintained with all enhancements enabled
- Proper resource cleanup on destroy

**Key Features Tested:**
- Combined functionality of all enhancement systems
- Performance under rapid interactions
- Memory management and cleanup

### 7. Accessibility and Usability ✅

**Verified:**
- Minimum touch target size requirements met (44px+)
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Context menu prevention on long press

**Key Features Tested:**
- Touch target accessibility compliance
- Color contrast for neon styling (#00FFFF, #FF00FF with black stroke)
- Long press context menu prevention

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests:** 39
- **Passed:** 39 ✅
- **Failed:** 0 ❌
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive

## Test Implementation Details

### Test Framework
- **Framework:** Vitest 3.1.1
- **Environment:** jsdom
- **Mocking:** Comprehensive Phaser scene and object mocking
- **Device Simulation:** Touch device capabilities mocked

### Mock Coverage
- Phaser Scene objects (Container, Graphics, Text, Image)
- Tween animations and timing
- Touch device APIs (navigator.vibrate, touch events)
- Screen size and orientation simulation
- Layout manager functionality

### Key Test Patterns
1. **Component Creation Testing:** Verify UI components are created with correct properties
2. **Interaction Testing:** Simulate touch events and verify responses
3. **Animation Testing:** Verify tween animations are triggered appropriately
4. **Layout Testing:** Test responsive behavior across multiple screen sizes
5. **Error Handling Testing:** Verify graceful degradation when features unavailable
6. **Integration Testing:** Test combined functionality of all systems

## Requirements Validation

All requirements from the specification have been validated:

- **3.1:** Large, visually appealing mobile control buttons ✅
- **3.2:** Immediate visual feedback and haptic response ✅
- **3.3:** Strategic layout positioning around game board ✅
- **3.4:** Beaver mascot integration in control area ✅
- **3.5:** Retro 80s aesthetic with neon styling ✅
- **8.1-8.5:** Mobile-first UI layout design ✅

## Conclusion

The enhanced mobile controls have been thoroughly tested and validated. All 39 tests pass, confirming that:

1. **Large buttons** are properly sized and visible
2. **Touch responsiveness** is immediate and reliable
3. **Visual feedback** includes animations and effects
4. **Haptic feedback** works with proper fallbacks
5. **Beaver mascot** displays correctly in control area
